## 🔧 Implementation Options

### Option 1: Full Enhancement (Recommended)
Replace existing PSA with enhanced version:
```javascript
// In psa.astro
import EnhancedPSASystem from "../../../components/dashboard/EnhancedPSASystem.jsx";
<EnhancedPSASystem client:only="react" />
```

### Option 2: Gradual Rollout
Add enhanced PSA as new route while keeping original:
```
/dashboard/onboarding/psa           -> Original PSA (preserved)
/dashboard/onboarding/enhanced-psa  -> Enhanced PSA (new)
```

### Option 3: A/B Testing
Use feature flags to test enhanced vs original:
```javascript
const useEnhancedPSA = user.features?.enhancedPSA || false;
return useEnhancedPSA ? <EnhancedPSASystem /> : <PSASigningSystemEmbedded />;
```
