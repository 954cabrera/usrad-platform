- **Enterprise Security**: Row-level security protecting multi-tenant data
- **Competitive Advantage**: Technology sophistication exceeding RadNet, SimonMed, and traditional healthcare platforms

---

## Project Objectives

### Initial Challenge
USRad's imaging center dashboard was operating with:
- **Static mock data** limiting realistic demonstrations to prospects
- **localStorage-based** PSA status management (client-side only)
- **No real-time updates** when users completed onboarding steps
- **Manual qualification** of serious prospects vs. tire kickers
- **Limited scalability** for enterprise customer growth

### Strategic Goals
1. **Real-time Progressive Disclosure**: Features unlock instantly upon PSA completion
2. **Database-Driven User Management**: Centralized user state management via Supabase
3. **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Multi-tenant data protection with row-level security
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Foundation supporting 1,500+ imaging centers
5. **Premium Positioning**: Technology sophistication justifying enterprise partnerships

## Technical Implementation

### Database Architecture

**Enhanced Imaging Centers Schema:**
```sql
-- Extended existing imaging_centers table with user management
ALTER TABLE imaging_centers ADD COLUMN owner_user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);
ALTER TABLE imaging_centers ADD COLUMN onboarding_status JSONB DEFAULT '{
  "psa_signed": false,
  "premium_features_unlocked": false,
  "support_tier": "basic",
  "revenue_analytics_enabled": false
}';
```

**New User Management Tables:**
- **user_profiles**: Extended user data with PSA status, onboarding progress, network access levels
- **psa_events**: Complete audit trail of PSA signing events
- **appointment_slots**: Real-time slot management for 1,500+ centers
- **revenue_analytics**: Premium dashboard data (PSA-gated)

### Progressive Disclosure Engine

**Smart Content Gating Logic:**
```javascript
// Real-time PSA status detection
const getSmartPSAStatus = () => {
  if (window.USRadUser?.profile?.psa_signed) return true;
  return false; // Use real Supabase data, not localStorage
};

// Progressive feature unlocking
const canAccessPremiumFeatures = () => {
  return hasCompletedPSA && networkAccessLevel === 'premium';
};
```

**Multi-Level Access Control:**
- **Level 1 (Basic)**: Implementation guides, basic training materials
- **Level 2 (Premium)**: Revenue analytics, advanced training, direct support
- **Level 3 (Enterprise)**: Network intelligence, market benchmarks, dedicated account management

### Real-Time User State Management

**USRadUser System:**
```javascript
window.USRadUser = {
  supabase: supabaseClient,
  user: currentUser,
  profile: userProfile,
  imagingCenter: centerData,
  
  // Real-time data loading
  async loadUserData() {
    // Fetches user, profile, and imaging center data
    // Updates UI automatically when PSA status changes
  },
  
  // PSA completion handler
  async completePSA(documentUrl, submissionId) {
    // Updates database and refreshes UI in real-time
  }
};
```

### Time-Based Banner Management

**Intelligent User Experience:**
- **Days 1-7**: Celebration banner for recent PSA completions
- **Days 8+**: Clean dashboard, no banner fatigue
- **Permanent**: Premium features remain unlocked
