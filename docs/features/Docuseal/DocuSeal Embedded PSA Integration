# 📄 DocuSeal Embedded PSA Integration – USRad Platform

## 🧩 Objective

To embed the **Provider Services Agreement (PSA)** into the USRad onboarding experience for imaging centers in a way that is:

* Seamless (no new tabs or popups)
* Intuitive to use
* Visually aligned with USRad’s premium UX
* Functionally integrated with user auth and onboarding progression

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Initial Problem

Previously, the PSA signing process:

* Redirected providers to a **DocuSeal-hosted external page**
* Created **context loss** post-signing (no clear return path)
* Lacked UI feedback (no success message, loading state, or redirect)

These limitations broke the onboarding flow and undermined trust in the process.

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Core Implementation

We replaced the popup model with an **in-page embedded signing experience**.

### Actions Taken:

1. **Created new embedded React component** (`PSASigningSystemEmbedded.jsx`)
2. **Dynamically fetched `embed_src`** via `/api/docuseal/create-submission-embedded`
3. Injected a `<docuseal-form>` element inside the DOM, tied to the provider’s email/name
4. Loaded DocuSeal’s form script once per session
5. Listened for `postMessage` events signaling form completion

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Experience Enhancements

We upgraded the user journey by adding:

* ⏳ **Animated loading spinner**
* 🎉 **Animated success banner with redirect**
* 🔄 **Auto-scroll to PSA section**
* 🧭 **Instructional guidance**: “Return to dashboard after signing”

Each element was designed with Tailwind CSS animations and smooth transitions to align with the polished UI goals.

## 🔍 Phase 4: Debug & Diagnostics

### ⚠️ Issue: `Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected`

We investigated this Supabase warning and confirmed:

* Singleton `supabase.js` file is correct ✅
* No duplicate `createClient()` calls found in uploaded code ✅
* Warning may stem from:

  * A **hot-reload artifact**
  * A **browser extension**
  * Or **DocuSeal’s embed script** (if it uses Supabase internally)

This is a non-breaking issue but still worth eliminating for stability.

| DocuSeal embed   | Confirm they aren’t injecting a separate Supabase client   | 🟡 In Progress |
| UX feedback      | Success banner wasn’t displaying properly                  | 🟡 Testing fix |
| Post-signing     | Add a dedicated "Back to Dashboard" CTA in form            | 🟡 Recommended |
| SSR/session sync | Ensure `loadUserData()` properly refreshes state post-sign | 🟡 Pending     |

## 🚀 Recommendations to Elevate Further

### 1. **Add Animated PSA Progress Tracker**

Display a visual stepper:

```text
[✔] Profile Info → [✔] PSA Signing → [ ] Center Details
```

### 2. **Lottie Animation on Success**

Use [`lottie-react`](https://github.com/Gamote/lottie-react) for success confirmation.

### 3. **Global Toast Notification System**

Abstract `window.showToast()` into a shared hook for use across all major flows.

### 4. **Store PSA Completion Timestamp**

In Supabase `user_metadata`, log:

```json
"psa_completed_at": "2025-06-08T23:45Z"
```

### 5. **Create DocuSeal Webhook Integration**

Build backend webhook endpoint to:

* Confirm PSA completion
* Trigger welcome sequence
* Update internal CRM/ops workflows

## 📌 Final Thoughts

You’ve transformed the PSA flow from an external, fragmented process into a **fully embedded, intelligent, and brand-aligned experience**. It’s a high-quality interaction that reflects USRad’s commitment to clarity, efficiency, and premium service delivery.

This milestone will be logged in the broader USRad build journal for presentation to investors, strategic advisors, and technical leads.
