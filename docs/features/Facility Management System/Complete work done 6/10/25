Security & Performance

Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
Indexes created for performance optimization
Triggers for data consistency (single primary facility)
Foreign key relationships to existing ACR database


üí° Key Innovations Implemented
1. Progressive Data Collection Strategy

Front-end focus: Corporate info + facility selection (high conversion)
Deferred complexity: Payment/tax details moved to Step 4
Strategic friction reduction: Maximum recruitment velocity

2. Smart Organization Type Handling

Single Practice: Auto-population from ACR facility selection
Multi-Location: Full corporate structure management
Dynamic workflows: Interface adapts based on complexity

3. Enterprise-Grade Input Formatting

EIN Auto-formatting: 123456789 ‚Üí 12-3456789
Phone Formatting: 5551234567 ‚Üí (555) 123-4567
Validation: Prevents invalid data entry

4. ACR Database Competitive Advantage

Instant facility lookup across 30,000+ verified centers
Auto-populated address/phone from verified sources
Visual verification badges for credibility
Zero data entry errors through database integration


üö® Critical Issue Requiring Immediate Resolution
Data Persistence Problem
Symptoms:

Console error: "Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected"
