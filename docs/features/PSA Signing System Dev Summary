Current Working Status üéØ
What's Fully Functional:
‚úÖ User Authentication Flow: Login ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí PSA Access
‚úÖ PSA Document Loading: DocuSeal form loads correctly in iframe
‚úÖ Digital Signing: Users can complete and sign PSA documents
‚úÖ Navigation Integration: Embedded within existing dashboard layout
‚úÖ Progress Tracking: Real-time updates to user completion status
‚úÖ Error Handling: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
DocuSeal Integration Success:
‚úÖ API Authentication: Working with DocuSeal Cloud credentials
‚úÖ Template Access: Successfully accessing template ID 1155842
‚úÖ Document Generation: Creating submissions with proper submitter data
‚úÖ Embed URL Generation: Receiving valid signing URLs
‚úÖ Form Loading: PSA document displays correctly for signing

Outstanding Issues Requiring Resolution ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. Field Pre-Population (Primary Issue)
Status: PSA form loads but fields are not pre-populated with user data
Current Behavior:

DocuSeal form displays with empty fields
User must manually enter all information
Field mapping between API and template needs alignment

Required Fix:

Verify field names in DocuSeal template match API payload
Implement proper values mapping for form field population
Test field population with actual user metadata

Expected Field Mapping:
javascriptvalues: {
  primary_contact_name: user.firstName + " " + user.lastName,
  primary_contact_email: user.email,
  provider_name: facility.name,
  tax_id: facility.taxId,
  // ... additional fields
}
2. Environment Variable Caching (Technical Debt)
Status: Astro caching old DocuSeal API tokens despite .env updates
Current Workaround:

Hardcoded API token in production code
Manual token management required for updates

Required Fix:

Implement proper environment variable loading
Clear Astro cache handling for development
Production-ready environment management

Recommended Solution:
javascript// Production approach
const apiKey = import.meta.env.DOCUSEAL_API_TOKEN;
if (!apiKey) throw new Error('DOCUSEAL_API_TOKEN not configured');
3. Facility Validation Integration (Development Priority)
Status: Currently bypassed for testing - needs production implementation
Current State:

Validation function exists but returns true for all cases
No integration with user facility data
Missing facility completeness checking

Required Implementation:

Connect to user profile facility data
Validate required facility information exists
Implement proper error handling for incomplete facilities
User guidance for facility setup completion


Integration Points and Dependencies üîó
Database Schema Requirements:
user_profiles table needs:

onboarding_progress (integer) - tracks completion percentage
psa_signed (boolean) - PSA completion status
facility_complete (boolean) - facility setup status
imaging_center_id (uuid) - links to facility data

API Endpoints:

‚úÖ /api/docuseal/create-submission - DocuSeal integration
üîÑ /api/user/facility-validation - Facility completeness checking
