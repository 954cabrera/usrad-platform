# USRad Dashboard Development Progress Report

## Overview

This report outlines the work completed, the rationale behind UI/UX changes, and the roadmap for future improvements to the USRad Imaging Dashboard. The dashboard is designed to onboard imaging centers, guide them through PSA (Provider Service Agreement) completion, and provide a sophisticated yet intuitive user interface aligned with Fortune 500 standards.

## âœ… Completed in Current Phase

### 1. Unified Sidebar Navigation

* Replaced fragmented sidebar sections with a single declarative `map()`-based navigation list.
* Introduced consistent structure for links with icons, labels, and PSA-locking logic.
* Removed redundant sections like "Premium Tools," "Network Resources," and multiple nav groups.

### 2. Visual Divider for Mental Grouping

* Inserted a visual `<hr>` divider between always-available tools and PSA-locked features.
* Reinforces mental model: top = accessible, bottom = premium unlocks.
* Dynamic: divider only appears if locked items are present.

### 3. PSA Completion Banner

* Dismissible alert displayed conditionally when `user?.hasCompletedPSA === false`.
* Fixed to top of the page with call-to-action linking to `/dashboard/onboarding`.
* Sidebar padding adjusted dynamically to prevent overlay on the USRad logo.

### 4. Sidebar Unlock Premium Card

* Converted floating Unlock CTA into a clickable card in the sidebar.
* Directs to `/dashboard/onboarding`.
* Removed all floating button clutter and improved consistency.

### 5. Dynamic Lock Logic for All Navigation

* Unified locking state using a single `isLocked` check across all nav links.
* Tooltip shown on hover only for locked features.
* Lock icon conditionally rendered only for gated items.

### 6. Instant Tooltip Experience

* Customized tooltip behavior using `::after`:

  * Instant `opacity: 1` on hover
  * Quick `opacity: 0` fade-out on exit
  * Transition timing: `0.1s` for snappy UX

## ðŸ”§ In Progress / Future Enhancements

### 1. Dynamic PSA Completion Integration

* Replace manual `user?.hasCompletedPSA` with real-time Supabase query.
* Sync locked/unlocked state based on actual onboarding step.

### 2. Analytics & Demo Content

* Populate `/dashboard/analytics` with mock data for demo mode.
* Apply PSA lock masking on premium metrics.
* Remove masking when PSA is completed.

### 3. Resources & Training Merge Plan

* Consider merging Training + Resources into a single Learning Center module.
* Include:

  * Onboarding videos
  * CPT code guides
  * Workflow PDFs
  * Tech support documentation

### 4. Post-PSA Success Experience

* Remove top banner immediately on PSA completion.
* Auto-refresh unlocked content.
* Optional celebration animation (e.g., confetti, toast, progress modal).

### 5. Accessibility Enhancements

* Add `tabindex` and `role="button"` to sidebar Unlock card.
* Support `Enter` key navigation for keyboard users.
