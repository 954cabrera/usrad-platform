# Progressive Disclosure - Technical Implementation Notes

## Files Modified/Created
- `/src/components/dashboard/PSASigningSystemEmbedded.jsx` - Enhanced PSA component with Supabase integration
- `/src/components/dashboard/SkeletonProviderDashboardSystem.jsx` - Progressive disclosure dashboard
- `/src/pages/api/docuseal/create-submission-embedded.ts` - Fixed DocuSeal API endpoint
- `/src/pages/dashboard/onboarding/psa.astro` - Updated PSA page imports
- `/src/pages/dashboard/index.astro` - Dashboard with PSA completion detection
- `astro.config.mjs` - Updated for server-side rendering support

## Key Technical Achievements
1. Multi-method PSA completion detection (DocuSeal events, window messages, polling)
2. Progressive content unlocking based on user metadata
3. Supabase integration with localStorage fallback
4. Enterprise-grade debug logging system
5. Real-time dashboard state management

## Environment Requirements
- DocuSeal API Key (DOCUSEAL_API_KEY)
- Supabase configuration (PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
- Astro output: 'server' mode for API routes

## Testing Status
✅ PSA creation and embedding working
✅ Completion detection functional (manual testing)
✅ Progressive disclosure state management working
✅ Dashboard content unlocking verified
⚠️ Requires DocuSeal production upgrade for real signing
⚠️ Supabase client integration needs completion for production
