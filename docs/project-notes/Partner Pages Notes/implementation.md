I'd be happy to outline the Implementation Process page for your USRad partner section, which will show potential partners exactly how the onboarding works and what to expect when joining the network.

This Implementation Process page complements the Partnership Model page by showing potential partners exactly how easy it is to join the USRad network. The page maintains the luxury healthcare aesthetic while providing clear, detailed information about:

Timeline: The 2-3 week process from application to first patient
Integration Options: Flexible methods that work with their existing systems
Support: Ongoing assistance available through multiple channels
Training Resources: Comprehensive materials to ensure staff preparedness

The page emphasizes how the implementation process is designed to minimize disruption to the center's existing operations, which is important for busy imaging centers. It also addresses common concerns through the FAQ section.
