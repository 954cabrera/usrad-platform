# Implementation Plan

The about.astro page has already been organized with the following sections in this order:

1. Problem (Hero Section)
2. Solution ("But we are")
3. Foundation (Company Story)
4. Vision (Our Vision Forward)
5. "New Standard" section
6. "Care That's Clear" section
7. Technology section with partner logos
8. Values section
9. Team section
10. Contact & FAQ section

## Necessary Changes

1. **Maintain sections 1-4** as they already follow the requested progression

2. **Consolidate sections 5-6** into a single "Patient Experience" section:
   - Use the design structure from the draft in patient-experience-section.md
   - Keep the strongest elements from both original sections
   - Focus on tangible patient benefits
   - This replaces both the "New Standard" and "Care That's Clear" sections

3. **Add transitions between sections:**
   - Add a transition from Vision → Patient Experience
   - Add a transition from Patient Experience → Technology
   - Add a transition from Technology → Values 
   - Add a transition from Values → Team
   - Add a transition from Team → Contact/FAQ

4. **Keep sections 7-10** with their current content but in the reorganized order:
   - Technology section (ensure partner logos only appear once)
   - Values section
   - Team section
   - Contact & FAQ section

## Implementation Steps

1. **First update:** Replace the "New Standard" section with the new "Patient Experience" section
   - Add transition text at the end of the Vision section
   - Include transition text at the end of the Patient Experience section
   
2. **Second update:** Remove the now-redundant "Care That's Clear" section

3. **Third update:** Add transition text at the end of the Technology section pointing to Values

4. **Fourth update:** Add transition text at the end of the Values section pointing to Team

5. **Fifth update:** Add transition text at the end of the Team section pointing to Contact/FAQ

## Benefits of Implementation

- Creates a clearer narrative flow from problem → solution → foundation → vision → experience → technology → values → team → contact
- Reduces redundancy by consolidating similar sections
- Maintains the visual aesthetics and branding
- Enhances the focus on tangible patient benefits
- Creates smoother transitions between conceptual sections

The implementation will maintain all the existing visual styling, aesthetic elements, and branding while improving the overall narrative structure of the page.
