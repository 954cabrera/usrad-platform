# Page Reorganization Plan

## Requested Section Order
1. Problem (Hero Section) - keep as is
2. Solution ("But we are") - keep as is
3. Foundation (Company Story) - keep as is
4. Vision (Our Vision Forward) - keep as is
5. The Patient Experience (NEW consolidated section)
   - Combines "New Standard" and "Care That's Clear" sections
   - Keeps strongest elements from both
   - Focuses on tangible benefits for patients
   - Maintains same visual structure as other sections
6. Technology section - keep with repositioned partners (only once)
7. Values section - moved to follow Technology
8. Team section - kept after Values
9. Contact & FAQ - kept as final section

## Implementation Details

### The Patient Experience Section (NEW)
This section will consolidate elements from both the "New Standard" and "Care That's Clear" sections:

- Visual aesthetics from "New Standard" (rounded images, amber gold accents)
- Patient-focused content from both sections
- Key benefit bullets using the dot styling from "Care That's Clear"
- Clear transition statements between this section and adjacent sections

### Section Transitions
Each section will include a brief connecting sentence or phrase to create a smooth narrative flow:

1. Hero → Solution: "But we are changing that with a better approach..."
2. Solution → Foundation: "Our journey toward this solution began with a simple question..."
3. Foundation → Vision: "Building on our foundation, we're moving toward a future where..."
4. Vision → Patient Experience: "This vision translates to a tangible experience for our patients..."
5. Patient Experience → Technology: "Behind every patient experience is technology you can trust..."
6. Technology → Values: "Our technology is guided by these core principles..."
7. Values → Team: "These values are embodied by our founding team..."
8. Team → Contact/FAQ: "Have questions for our team? We're here to help..."

### Structural Changes
- The Patient Experience section will use a combined aesthetic from both source sections
- Technology section will only display partner logos once within the section
- Section order will be adjusted according to the plan
- All sections will maintain their current visual styling, with adjustments only to content placement and transitions

## Next Steps
The implementation will require editing the about.astro file to reorganize these sections according to the plan. The changes will focus on section order, transition text, and consolidating the duplicate sections while maintaining visual consistency.
