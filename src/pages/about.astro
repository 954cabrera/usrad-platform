        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Michael Cabrera’s entrepreneurial journey began at age 13 on a red
          Raleigh bicycle, delivering newspapers. That early hustle evolved into
          two decades of leadership in healthcare, where he’s scaled national
          companies using a clear operational framework: People, Strategy,
          Execution, and Cash.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          As a graduate of MIT’s Entrepreneurial Masters Program, Michael built
          a radiology startup that grew 1,236% before being acquired by a public
          company. But beyond the numbers, he’s known for leading with empathy,
          cultivating resilient teams, and merging purpose with performance.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          His values extend beyond business. Through employee-led philanthropy,
          he championed causes like Cystic Fibrosis and Autism. Recognized by
          Inc. Magazine and the South Florida Business Journal, Michael
          continues to mentor rising leaders while staying anchored in mission.
